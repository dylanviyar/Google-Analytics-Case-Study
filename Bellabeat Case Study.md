### Author: Dylan Viyar
### Last Updated: 2023-09-06




This case study is the final project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, hosted on Coursera. This analysis follows the data exploration process of *Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act*


# 1: ASK

#### In this step, we ask meaningful, purposeful and insightful questions to clearly define the business task.

### 1.0 The Setting

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health focused products for women, founded in 2013. The small company is looking to become a larger player in the wellness market, particularly in the realm of smart devices and wearable technology.

The executive staff at Bellabeat would like to conduct analysis on consumer usage of similar *non-Bellabeat* smart devices to gain insights on possible marketing strategies and opportnities.

### 1.1 Key Stakeholders

1. Urška Sršen: Cofounder of Bellabeat and Chief Creative Officer
2. Sando Mur: Cofounder of Bellabeat, Mathematician, and key member of Bellabeat's executive team
3. Bellabeat's Marketing Analytics Team: Team of data analysts working together to collect, analyze and report relevant data to supplement Bellabeat's marketing strategy

### 1.2 Guiding Questions
*Note: When deciding what type of questions to ask to motivate analysis, it is important to ensure that the questions being asked are 'SMART' (**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ction-orientated, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound)*

1. What are are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How can these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How can these trends ultimately influence the marketing strategy of Bellabeat?

### 1.3 Deliverables for the Case Study

1. A clear outline of the business task
2. A description of the data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning, manipulation or wrangling of the data
4. A summary of the analysis
5. Supplemental visualizations and key findings
6. A set of data-driven recommendations based on the analysis

### 1.4 The Business Task 

*Analyze FitBit Fitness Tracker Data on user's daily habits to identify trends in usage and how those trends can impact Bellabeat's marketing strategy.*

---

# 2. PREPARE

#### In this step, we determine the quality of the data we have to work with and understand the possible limitations of our analysis due to the data source.

### 2.0 Background Information on the Data Source

1. The dataset is open data; available to the public on Kaggle as  [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)
2. The dataset was generated by 30 respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk through March 2016 to May 2016
3. The data includes information on heart rate, sleep monitoring, steps, and heart rate, which can be used to explore users’ habits
4. The data is stored in 18 CSV files

### 2.1 Downloading the Data

1. In this case study, SQL is used as the main tool for processing analysis
2. The files chosen for exploration, `dailyActivity_merged.csv` and `SleepDay.csv` contain information about user fitness information specifically: distance, steps, minutes of activity and sleeping habits

### 2.2 Possible Limitations of the Dataset

1. There is a high chance of sampling bias, 30 respondents may not accurately represent the total female population
2. The dataset was collected in 2016, trends identified may no longer be accurate to the current findings
3. Without access to the original survey, we cannot be confident that the data collection was done completely ethically and without bias
4. We do not have any information of the 30 people who's data were collected

### 2.3 Does the Data ROCC? 
*When evaluatiing the status of data to be used for analysis, a simple test is to see if the data you are using is 'ROCC' (**R**eliable, **O**riginal, **C**omprehensive, **C**urrent, **C**ited)*

1. Reliable: -*No*- We are unsure how well the sample represents the total population of women
2. Original : -*No*- The dataset is gathered from an external source (Amazon Mechanical Turk), it was not collected firsthand
3. Comprehensive: -*Yes*- The dataset has information relevant to Bellabeat, specfically metrics related to wearable technology, an area that Bellabeat wants to expand in
4. Current: -*No*- The data is from 2016, six years ago
5. Cited: -*No*- We are unsure how the external source cited the data

Our provided dataset does not 'ROCC,' thus further exploration and analysis is required to ensure the accurary of our findngs.

---

# 3. PROCESS 
#### In this step, we clean our data; we ensure that the data is relevant, error-free and holds its integrity.

### 3.0 Understanding our SQL Tables

1. To get an intial feel of our tables we can run the following queries to see the schema of our data and view all the column names as well as their data types:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` 
WHERE table_name = 'DailyActivity'
```
<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/1564dc03-b842-438f-a693-32a25feda963" alt="Daily Activity Table Column Names and DataTypes" width="300">

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` 
WHERE table_name = 'SleepDay'
```
<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/60eb95f9-1588-4169-a8cd-85256520887d" width="300"> 


We see that there is a total of 15 columns in our `DailyActivity` table and 5 columns in our `SleepDay` table, all with various data types.

2. Now that we understand the columns of our tables, we can preview the tables to observe the values that the attributes have:

![DailyActivityPreview](https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/14c66fcb-c545-4f6e-86b8-3ea23f180066)

![sleepdaypreview1](https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/ee845a4b-f20b-40a1-a2a7-b2640a2fbb6f)


We can see a quick snapshot of our tables, and the bottom right  shows that there is a total of 940 rows in the `DailyActivity` table and 413 rows in our `SleepDay` table. We can begin cleaning the data.

### 3.1 Cleaning our Data

Now that we have a basic idea of how our data looks and its characteristics, we can begin to process our data for analysis.
Some **Key Steps** include:
1. Dealing with NULL and missing values
2. Removing duplicates
3. Checking for data type errors (inconsistent/mismatched data types)
4. Spell checking the data
5. Ensuring the data stays relevant to the business task

- Here, we are checking the data tables for any possible NULL values that we may have to deal with:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` 
WHERE Id IS NULL
OR ActivityDate IS NULL
OR TotalSteps IS NULL
OR TotalDistance IS NULL
OR TrackerDistance IS NULL
OR LoggedActivitiesDistance IS NULL
OR VeryActiveDistance IS NULL
OR ModeratelyActiveDistance IS NULL
OR LightActiveDistance IS NULL
OR SedentaryActiveDistance IS NULL
OR VeryActiveMinutes IS NULL
OR FairlyActiveMinutes IS NULL
OR LightlyActiveMinutes IS NULL
OR SedentaryMinutes IS NULL
OR Calories IS NULL
```
<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/f8692399-fea0-4e99-b2c1-88a2415baa38" width="250">

```sql
SELECT *  
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` 
WHERE Id IS NULL
OR SleepDay IS NULL
OR TotalSleepRecords IS NULL
OR TotalMinutesAsleep IS NULL
OR TotalTimeInBed IS NULL
```

<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/f8692399-fea0-4e99-b2c1-88a2415baa38" width="250">

We can see that there are no rows with NULL values.

- While analyzing the `DailyActivity` table, I noticed that there was some inconsistencies in the naming of the columns. To keep the column names consistent, I renamed `FairlyActiveMinutes` to `ModeratelyActiveMinutes`, `LightActiveDistance` to `LightlyActiveDistance` and `SedentaryMinutes` to `SedentaryActiveMinutes`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity
RENAME COLUMN FairlyActiveMinutes to ModeratelyActiveMinutes
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity
RENAME COLUMN LightActiveDistance to LightlyActiveDistance
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity
RENAME COLUMN SedentaryMinutes to SedentaryActiveMinutes
```

<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/ba871a42-ae8c-4ce8-b75a-ccc21c086ed8" width="225">

- We can use the `DISTINCT` statement in SQL to ensure that there are exactly 30 *unique* ids in the tables, one unique id for each survey respondent:

```sql
SELECT count(DISTINCT Id) AS Num_of_Unique_Ids
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` 
```

<img src= "https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/b4855f19-a638-4565-b041-1d07ecf973e4" width="180">

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Num_of_Unique_Ids
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` 
```
<img src ="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/3e40ab95-d77f-47e4-ba06-2286189e03f9" width="180">

We retrieve 33 and 24 distinct ids, when we expected 30, we need to express this to our stakeholders, primarily the other members of the data analysis team

- The following queries checks the entire table to see if there are any duplicate rows:

```sql
SELECT Id,ActivityDate,TotalSteps,TotalDistance,TrackerDistance,LoggedActivitiesDistance,VeryActiveDistance,ModeratelyActiveDistance,LightlyActiveDistance,SedentaryActiveDistance,VeryActiveMinutes,ModeratelyActiveMinutes,LightlyActiveMinutes,SedentaryActiveMinutes,Calories, count(*) AS NumberOfDistinctRows
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` 
GROUP BY Id,ActivityDate,TotalSteps,TotalDistance,TrackerDistance,LoggedActivitiesDistance,VeryActiveDistance,ModeratelyActiveDistance,LightlyActiveDistance,SedentaryActiveDistance,VeryActiveMinutes,ModeratelyActiveMinutes,LightlyActiveMinutes,SedentaryActiveMinutes,Calories
HAVING count(*)>1
```

<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/f8692399-fea0-4e99-b2c1-88a2415baa38" width="250">

There are no duplicate rows in the `DailyActivity` table

```sql
SELECT Id,SleepDay,TotalSleepRecords,TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed, count(*) AS NumberOfDistinctRows
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` 
GROUP BY Id,SleepDay,TotalSleepRecords,TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed
HAVING count(*)>1
```
![DuplicateRows SleepDay](https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/bb7b7f80-5a30-4df3-9a15-ad48228329cb)

We see that there are duplicates in our `SleepDay` table, the following query creates a new table with only distinct rows:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` AS
SELECT
DISTINCT *
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay`
```
Now, both tables only contain distinct, unique rows.

- Adding `TotalMinutes`, `Day`, `MinutesActive`, `HoursActive` and `RatioActiveMin` columns to prepare `DailyActivity` table for analysis:

```sql
--Replacing DailyActivity with another table that has the TotalMinutes column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` AS
SELECT *,
VeryActiveMinutes + ModeratelyActiveMinutes + LightlyActiveMinutes + SedentaryActiveMinutes AS TotalMinutes
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity`
```

```sql
--Replacing DailyActivity with another table that has the Day column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` AS
SELECT *,
  FORMAT_DATE('%A', ActivityDate) AS Day
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity`;
```

```sql
--Replacing DailyActivity with another table that has the ActiveMinutes column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` AS
SELECT *,
VeryActiveMinutes + ModeratelyActiveMinutes + LightlyActiveMinutes  AS ActiveMinutes
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity`
```

```sql
--Replacing DailyActivity with another table that has the HoursActive column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` AS
SELECT *,
ActiveMinutes/60  AS HoursActive
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity`
```

```sql
--Replacing DailyActivity with another table that has the RatioActiveMin column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` AS
SELECT *,
ActiveMinutes/TotalMinutes  AS RatioActiveMin
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity`
```

```sql
--Looking at our new columns in our DailyActivity Table
SELECT 
TotalMinutes,
Day,
ActiveMinutes,
HoursActive,
RatioActiveMin
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity`
```

<img src ="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/b2c8798f-6e71-448a-8639-21fbfb8d6c96" width="500">

- Adding `TotalHoursAsleep`, `TotalHoursInBed` , `MinutesDifference` and `Day` to `SleepDay`:

```sql
--Replacing SleepDay with another table that has the TotalHoursAsleep column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` AS
SELECT *,
TotalMinutesAsleep/60  AS TotalHoursAsleep
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay`
```

```sql
--Replacing SleepDay with another table that has the TotalHoursInBed column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` AS
SELECT *,
TotalTimeInBed/60  AS TotalHoursInBed
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay`
```
```sql
--Replacing SleepDay with another table that has the MinutesDifference column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` AS
SELECT *,
TotalTimeInBed-TotalMinutesAsleep AS MinutesDifference
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay`
```
```sql
--Replacing SleepDay with another table that has the Day column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` AS
SELECT *,
  FORMAT_DATE('%A', SleepDay) AS Day
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay`;
```
```sql
--Looking at our new columns in our SleepDay Table
SELECT 
TotalHoursAsleep,
TotalHoursinBed,
MinutesDifference,
Day
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay`
```
<img src ="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/530b8c07-eb83-4064-976e-424b21c96be1" width="400">



### 3.2 Key Takeaways From Data Cleansing

1. Our tables have no NULL values
2. We had duplicate rows in our `SleepDay` table, we were able to remove the duplicate rows
3. We have 33 and 24 total unique ids, contrary to the expected 30
4. There seems to be an usual amount of recordings of `TotalMinutes` of 1440 in the `DailyActivity` table

Now, our data is clean and ready for analysis.

# 4. ANALYZE
#### In this step, we calculate metrics, examine patterns and summarize our data to help answer our business task.

### 4.1 Gathering Summary Statistics

While analyzing it is important to look at specific data calculations, most notably:
1. SUM
2. MEAN
3. MAX
4. MIN
5. STANDARD DEVIATION

#### Summary Statistics for `DailyActivity`:
---
SUM Statisitic:

*Note:* All the above tables are grouped by `DAY`

**Key Takeaways From `DailyActivity` Summary Statistics:**

1. Tuesday has the highest average of calories burnt
2. Thursday has both the high calories burnt and the lowest calories burnt
3. There seems to be a positive correlation between number of steps and calories burnt

*Note:* All the above tables are grouped by `DAY`

**Key Takeaways From `SleepDay` Summary Statistics:**

1. The respondents had the most cummulative sleep on Wednesdays, but the most average amount of sleep per night on Sundays
2. On average, people stay in bed the longest, sleeping or not, on Sundays
3. On Monday a had the highest amount of hours of sleep
4. Interestingly, the lowest recording of sleep duration of less than an hour, took place on a Sunday

### 4.2 Other Calculations for Analysis

Aside from the summary statistics, additional calculations are helpful for finding patterns and trends. Supplemental calculations I decided to analyze were:

1. Most frequent day that the respondents excerise
2. Relationship between calories and time active
3. Relationship between calories and distance travelled
4. Relationship between amount of sleep and calories
5. Relationship between sleep and time active

```sql
--Determining which day of the week had the most recorded exercises
SELECT Day,
COUNT(Day) AS ExerciseOccurrences
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` 
GROUP BY Day
ORDER BY ExerciseOccurrences DESC
```
<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/9db94431-5b4f-4ebc-a7f3-04c3dcd9ef74" width="300">

Tuesday is the most preferred day for exercise according to our respondents

```sql
--Determining the relationship between calories and time active
SELECT 
Id,
AVG(Calories) AS AVGCalories,
AVG(VeryActiveMinutes) AS AVGVeryActiveMin,
AVG(ModeratelyActiveMinutes) AS AVGModeratelyActiveMins,
AVG(LightlyActiveMinutes) AS AVGLightlyActiveMins,
AVG(ActiveMinutes) AS AVGActiveMin,
AVG(TotalSteps) AS AVGSteps,
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` 
GROUP BY Id
ORDER BY AVGCalories DESC
```

<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/f8ca9f3f-c20b-48a0-b773-10cd6d2b5079" width="600">

There does not seem to be a clear correlation between calories and time active, further visualization is necessary to determine if any relationship exists

```sql
--Determining the relationship between calories and distance travelled
SELECT 
Id,
AVG(Calories) AS AVGCalories,
AVG(VeryActiveDistance) AS AVGVeryActiveDistance,
AVG(ModeratelyActiveDistance) AS AVGModeratelyActiveDistances,
AVG(LightlyActiveDistance) AS AVGLightlyActiveDistances,
AVG(TotalSteps) AS AVGSteps,
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` 
GROUP BY Id
ORDER BY AVGCalories DESC
```

<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/244a59ee-2793-412b-8140-159f27b421ac" width="600">

Similarly, there does not seem to be a clear correlation between calories and distance travelled

```sql
--Joining SleepDay and DailyActivity to analyze calories and amount of sleep
SELECT t1.Id,
AVG(t1.Calories) AS AVGCalories,
AVG(t2.TotalMinutesAsleep) AS AVGTotalMinutesAsleep,
AVG(t2.TotalHoursAsleep) AS AVGTotalHoursAsleep,
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` AS t1
JOIN `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` AS t2
ON t1.Id = t2.Id
GROUP BY t1.Id
ORDER BY AVGTotalMinutesAsleep DESC
```

<img src="https://github.com/dylanviyar/Google-Analytics-Case-Study/assets/81194849/63f670b1-5965-4d3a-b9b8-d3e24d34e754" width="400">

There seems to be a positive correlation between the amount of calories burnt and the amount of sleep an individual gets

```sql
--Joining SleepDay and DailyActivity to analyze time active and amount of sleep
SELECT t1.Id,
AVG(t1.ActiveMinutes) AS AVGActiveMinutes,
AVG(t1.HoursActive) AS AVGHoursActive,
AVG(t2.TotalMinutesAsleep) AS AVGTotalMinutesAsleep,
AVG(t2.TotalHoursAsleep) AS AVGTotalHoursAsleep,
FROM `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.DailyActivity` AS t1
JOIN `kinetic-axle-394521.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.SleepDay` AS t2
ON t1.Id = t2.Id
GROUP BY t1.Id
ORDER BY AVGTotalMinutesAsleep DESC
```

It is difficult to determine a relationship without further visualization, the next step in the data analysis process

### 4.3 Key Takeaways From Analysis

1. There doesn't seem to be a drastic difference in wellness habits during the weekends, the sample of respondents may not be working in the traditional 5 day work week
2. Need to visualize the relationship between calories and distance travelled/time active to further determine the correlation, if any at all
3. Amount of sleep has importance when understanding our respondent's wellness habits
